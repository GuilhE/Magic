## Details

### Shared

The modules `data-models`, `core-database`, and `core-network` are independent, while `data-managers` depends on all three.
Each module is responsible for providing its own Dependency Injection (DI) logic, but the `core-di` module manages the root DI system, utilised by all platforms.
This is why the `core-di` module depends on all other modules and will also contain the Objective-C framework settings.  

These five modules constitute the Shared Data Layer.

### Platforms

#### Android

The `MagicApp` serves as the entry point and includes the setup for DI. There's no Domain Layer and `Shared Data Layer` is the Data Layer itself. Finally, the `presentation` contains all the logic related to the UI Layer.

To run it `./gradlew :androidApp:installDebug`

#### iOS

The `App` package serves as the entry point and includes the setup for DI. 
The `Core` defines the DI protocols and container. The `Data` acts as a bridge between the App's Data Layer and the Shared Data Layer, where the implementation logic resides. 
The `Domain` contains the bridge protocols and data structures, and also the app protocols. Finally, the `Presentation` contains all the logic related to the UI Layer.

To run it open `iosApp/Magic.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run standard configuration or use [KMP plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/14936-kotlin-multiplatform) for Android Studio and choose `iosApp` in `run configurations`.
